    		<p> What is a Verb?</p>
    		

    		<p>A Verb is an word or phrase that describes an action, condition, or experience</p>

    		<p>Verbs come in three tenses: past, present, and future. The past is used to describe things that have already happened (e.g., earlier in the day, yesterday, last week, three years ago). The present tense is used to describe things that are happening right now, or things that are continuous. The future tense describes things that have yet to happen (e.g., later, tomorrow, next week, next year, three years from now).</p>

    		<!-- <p> The following table illustrates the proper use of verb tenses: </p>
